# ROBLOX 2015-2020 Templates Archive
### Welcome to bytebukkit's Templates Archive for KORNET!

> Feel free to use this on other projects aswell.

**Required:**
- A Old ROBLOX Studio or Current STUDIO Client (depending on what youre using it for)
- Some knowledge on how to open files using other executables or how to open Files in ROBLOX Studio, recommended is [Bukkit Studio for KORNET](https://github.com/bukkitstudio/cdn.loader/releases/tag/2020).
- [The .zip file from the releases.](https://github.com/bukkitstudio/templates/releases/tag/v1)

### IMPORTANT
Each template contains only **one** version of it including a Thumbnail and Icon file of the Template itself. You can find these on the [@Templates](https://www.roblox.com/users/998796/profile#!#creations) user on ROBLOX. These Templates are from 2015-2020, most of them are 2016.
## How do i download specific versions of Templates?
**This applies to all uncopylocked games or your own games / assets on ROBLOX**
- Step 1: Paste the following link into your URL Bar: `assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=PLACE_ID&version=VERSION_NUMBER`
- Replace PLACE_ID with a Place, Catalog or Asset ID, in this case you would most likely use a place id.
- Replace VERSION_NUMBER with your version of choice.
- On Download, make sure to add a roblox format file ending:

### Valid File Endings:
Asset/Catalog Items:

    .rbxm | .rbxmx (rbxmx uses XML Type formatting)
 
 Places:
 

    .rbxl | .rbxlx (rbxlx uses XML Type formatting)

## Opening your newly downloaded file
If you are using this for a revival like [KORNET](https://kornet.lat) then please open it in a valid studio client for this time period. A recommended studio client is the one i made for KORNET  specifically, can be used by any other person too with a KORNET account, [Check out BukkitStudio 2020](https://github.com/bukkitstudio/cdn.loader/releases/tag/2020)

Open the file in either your old studio client or for use in new Studio using standard ROBLOX Studio.

Thats already it!

## Things to note about Templates
The Starting Place Template Billboard uses a asset ID from Kornets Library, not ROBLOX. You can change this by changing the thumbnails asset id.

The Pirate Island Boat has been recolored due to the mesh texture bugging on KORNET.
